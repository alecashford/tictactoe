#TicTacToe
===

This is an unbeatable, web-based tic tac toe game; all games will result in either a draw or computer victory. While the mechanics of the game are simpe enough to make into a single page of HTML/JS, I chose to use a back and front end framework, Sinatra and AngularJS respectively, communicating between the two exclusively with API calls.
